This is a showcase application that I use to start new projects. I take what I need and bootstrap new development.
This is a Spring based Web Application using modern frameworks like JPA, Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, and most Spring
Frameworks. Here's a sample list of Technologies used:

- Spring Framework
- Spring Data
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven Build/Deploy
- Apache Tiles
- Hibernate JPA
- Spring Security
- Spring MVC
- Spring Web Flow
- LogBack

- Some other cool things

This showcase is meant to be self contained. All the is needed to run it is Java 6+ and Maven Installed. If you are on
